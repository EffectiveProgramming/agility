title: How Important Is Passion, Really?
---
I came across some verbiage for an iOS engineer and it got me to wondering ... how important is passion, really?

> Do you find other mobile platforms inferior to iOS? Do you constantly check MacRumors for the latest leaks from Cupertino? Have you camped at an Apple store for the latest device? If you answered yes to one of those questions, you would fit right in with us. If you answered yes to all of them, you’re EXACTLY what we’re looking for!

I am pretty passionate about what I do but in the course of my everyday work, I've run into a fairly wide spectrum of passion and skill sets. I've worked with some incredibly focussed people doing excellent work who'd readily admit to a lack of technical passion. I've also worked with some passionate diehards that had the opposite problem.

Be careful what you look for. Passion is orthogonal to hard working, focussed and a good fit.
