title: Stacked Kanban
---

A co-worker recently used this term to reference a proof-of-concept idea our team was using before we'd officially landed on a commercial kanban board.

It is based on the idea of a _spanplan_ - which oddly, I can't seem to Google very well.

For now, this page will act as a placeholder until I can take some time to document the idea.
